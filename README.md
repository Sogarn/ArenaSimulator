# ArenaSimulator
Loosely inspired by watching Fire Emblem Arena youtube videos <br />
Objective is to create a tournament bracket sim of randomly generated characters with custom mechanics and return the winner <br />
Can also balance the game using statistics from these simulated tournament brackets <br />
Stats will include things like HP, Strength, Magic, Defense, Resistance, Speed, Skill and Luck <br />
Will likely include random stat growths just to see what happens <br />
